        <h1 style="color: white">Crypto Currencies Are The Future Of Money</h1>
        <p style="color: white">
          Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have risen dramatically in
          popularity over the past decade. What is cryptocurrency, and why is it
          important?
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="introduction">
      <h3>What is Blockchain?</h3>
      <p>
        Blockchain is a shared record of transactions that are tied together to
        create a chain. Blockchains can be used to keep track of all sorts of
        things, but Bitcoin first used blockchain to issue currency and keep
        track of transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blockchains are made of networks of computers which all audit each
        other, and work together to create consensus on which transactions
        should be included in each block. A block is just a bundle of all the
        trasactions that happened over the last few minutes or seconds.
      </p>
      <h3>What Are The Advantages of Cryptocurrencies?</h3>
      <p>
        Cryptocurencies are decentralized systems, which means that there is no
        central authority in charge of each cryptocurrency. Traditional monetary
        systems all have central authorities that can control the distribution
        of the money, censor transactions, levy taxes, print new currency, and
        otherwise control the flow of money. Cryptocurrencies circumvent the
        need for central authorities which makes them more democratic and free.
      </p>
      <h3>Privacy and Security</h3>
      <p>
        Privacy and security are also something that should be considered when
        thinking about cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies will generally fall
        into two separate categories when considering their overall privacy and
        security concerns. Early cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin provide a
        traceable ledger of each transition. This makes it less private, but
        more secure in the sense that money laundering and counterfeit
        operations are useless through transaction tracing by law enforcement
        agencies and regulators. On the other hand, newer cryptocurrencies like
        Monero are filling a demand for a more privacy-centric approach to
        keeping identities and transactions concealed. While this invites the
        risk of criminal activities, it also provides a desired feature as
        privacy becomes a growing concern in the virtual world.
      </p>
      <h3>Cryptography in Blockchain</h3>
      <p>Blockchain and cryptocurrency systems use asymmetric public key 
      cryptography to make transactions between users secure. Each user has 
      a pair or public and private keys that are related cryptograpically 
      and allow for identity verification. Due to the nature of the cryptography 
      sytems, it is mathematically difficult to guess another users private key. 
      All public keys are publicly visible, and they are used to create 
      transactions which can only be "signed" by the private key associated 
      with that public key. Transactions belong to these public keys, which 
      function like an address. Since these key pairs are generated randomly 
      by putting random numbers into a hash function, there is no way to infer 
      the identity of the owner of an account.
