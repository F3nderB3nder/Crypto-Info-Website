                    Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have risen dramatically
                    in popularity over the past decade. What is cryptocurrency,
                    and why is it important?
                </p>

            <h3>What is blockchain?</h3>
            <p>
                Blockchain is a shared record of transactions that are tied
                together to create a chain. Blockchains can be used to keep
                track of all sorts of things, but Bitcoin first used blockchain
                to issue currency and keep track of transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Blockchains are made of networks of computers which all audit
                each other, and work together to create consensus on which
                transactions should be included in each block. A block is just a
                bundle of all the trasactions that happened over the last few
                minutes or seconds.
