                    Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have risen dramatically
                    in popularity over the past decade. What is cryptocurrency,
                    and why is it important?
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>What is blockchain?</h3>
            <p>
                Blockchain is a shared record of transactions that are tied
                together to create a chain. Blockchains can be used to keep
                track of all sorts of things, but Bitcoin first used blockchain
                to issue currency and keep track of transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Blockchains are made of networks of computers which all audit
                each other, and work together to create consensus on which
                transactions should be included in each block. A block is just a
                bundle of all the trasactions that happened over the last few
                minutes or seconds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most blockchains are public, which means that anyone can see all
                addresses on the blockchain, as well as their balance, and any
                transactions that have involved that address. Private
                blockchains also exist, where only the existence of transactions
                and their fees are recorded, but not the participants of the
                transaction, or the amount of the transaction. The best example
                of a public blockchain is Bitcoin, whereas the best example of a
                private blockchain is the Monero blockchain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyone can create an account on a blockchain for free. An
                account is just a public / private key pair, which are generated
                by a hash function. Hash functions are the basis of the
                cryptography that all blockchains use. Hash functions use
                asymmetric key cryptography, which is where the public and
                private keys come from. Funds are secure on the blockchain
                because only the person with the private key can sign
                transactions that involve those funds. Although anyone can see
                the public key associated with a transaction, the private key
                cannnot be inferred from the public key, so only the owner of
                the account can make transactions from that address.
            </p>
            <h3>What Are The Advantages of Cryptocurrencies?</h3>
            <p>
                Cryptocurencies are decentralized systems, which means that
                there is no central authority in charge of each cryptocurrency.
                Traditional monetary systems all have central authorities that
                can control the distribution of the money, censor transactions,
                levy taxes, print new currency, and otherwise control the flow
                of money. Cryptocurrencies circumvent the need for central
                authorities which makes them more democratic and free.
            </p>
            <p>
                Privacy and security are also something that should be
                considered when thinking about cryptocurrencies.
                Cryptocurrencies will generally fall into two separate
                categories when considering their overall privacy and security
                concerns. Early cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin provide a
                traceable ledger of each transition. This makes it less private,
                but more secure in the sense that money laundering and
                counterfeit operations are useless through transaction tracing
                by law enforcement agencies and regulators. On the other hand,
                newer cryptocurrencies like Monero are filling a demand for a
                more privacy-centric approach to keeping identities and
                transactions concealed. While this invites the risk of criminal
                activities, it also provides a desired feature as privacy
                becomes a growing concern in the virtual world.
